# Wingsuit Bowling! 

Inspired by the classic Flatout racing games, Wingsuit Bowling! looks to bring the fun of bowling with the chaos of using a wingsuit for a crazy good time. 

You are tasked with knocking down as many bowling pins as possible with only two shots, but instead of using bowling balls, You are the ball! 
Itâ€™s not just falling with style, you'll have to be mindful of your pitch, yaw, and speed to ensure they can not only get to the pins, but get the best hits possible.
